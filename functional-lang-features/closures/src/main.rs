    Example of creating a closure function and storing it in a variable.
    Method for defining a closure
    -----------------------------
    - The closure definition comes after the = to assign it to the variable expensive_closure.To define a closure,
      we start with a pair of vertical pipes (|), inside which we specify the parameters to the closure

    - let statement means expensive_closure contains the definition of an anonymous function, not the resulting value  of calling the anonymous function. Recall that weâ€™re using a closure because we want to define the code to call at one point, store that code, and call it at a later point; the code we want to call is now stored in expensive_closure.
